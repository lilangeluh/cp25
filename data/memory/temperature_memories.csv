"Swan Lake, Shenzhen",Feeding the ducks,"I grew up near a manmade lake where the ducks glided in like little boats. At first every quack scared me; I’d hide behind my mom’s legs while the bread bag crinkled in her hands. Eventually I learned they weren’t monsters, just hungry. I’d tug at her sleeve on bakery days, begging for an extra roll “for the ducks,” heart pounding as they waddled closer and snapped crumbs from my outstretched palm.",13:47,6/16/04,,ducks,"22.5° N, 113.9° E","	•	Air: lake-warm

"Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan",Snack-bribed hike,"On that first Jiuzhaigou trip, the 7km trail felt endless. My mom’s backpack was a traveling snack stand, each cookie a tiny contract to keep walking. My legs ached, lungs burning in the thin mountain air, squirrels darting across the path like they wanted my crackers more than I did. By the time I reached the end on my own two feet, sweat cooling under my jacket, I realized I hadn’t asked to be carried once.",12:48,2/14/07,,barbie,"33.2° N, 104.0° E","	•	Steps: tiny but steady

"OCT, Shenzhen",Youngest calligraphy kid,"In the summer calligraphy class, I was the only five-year-old, feet dangling off the chair while everyone else looked like actual students. The room smelled like ink and hot dust. The teacher kept uncurling my fingers, correcting my grip on the brush, even as sweat slid down my back and tickled my neck. I wanted to hold it my way, but I kept trying again, filling sheet after sheet with shaky characters that slowly started to look intentional.",14:05,7/19/08,,caligraphy,"22.5° N, 113.9° E","		•	Heat: sticky summer

"Disneyland, Anaheim",First Mickey hug,"My first Disneyland trip smelled like popcorn, asphalt, and sunscreen. I inched toward Mickey, half convinced he might actually talk to me. When he hugged me, the costume smelled like fresh laundry and plastic, which my brain translated as “magic.” Rollercoasters roared somewhere else in the park, safely out of my plans. I was happiest in the character lines, clutching my autograph book and posing like this was the only kind of thrill I’d ever need.",12:51,8/30/08,,mickey,"33.8° N, 117.9° W","		•	Air: soft and warm

"Hell Valley, Noboribetsu",First snow storm,"Hokkaido wind sliced straight through my coat the first time I saw real snow. At Noboribetsu’s Hell Valley, steam rose from the ground while snow blew sideways, stinging my face and drowning out sound. I shuffled along the icy path, fingers numb around my scarf. Later, looking at the photos, I noticed my grandpa’s whole fit—coat, sunglasses, stance—like he owned the valley. At the time I was just cold; now I see how cool he actually looked.",15:01,12/18/11,,grandpa,"42.5° N, 141.1° E","		•	Air: loud with snow

Gold Coast koala park,Koala ear to cheek,"At the koala zoo, the air was thick and sweet with eucalyptus. When the staff settled the koala into my arms, it was heavier than I expected, claws hooking gently into my shirt. Then it turned its head and one fluffy ear brushed my cheek. I almost screamed from how painfully cute it was, but I held my face in a calm, “normal” smile for the camera while my brain looped, I am holding a koala, over and over.",12:38,1/31/13,,koala,"28.0° S, 153.4° E","		•	Fur: warm brush

Katmai National Park,Bear with salmon,"On the bridge at Katmai, July still felt like early spring. I gripped my dad’s long lens with both hands, trying to keep the bear in frame as it moved through the river. The water roared under the platform, cold air rushing up with it. When the bear snapped a salmon mid-leap and stood there chewing, looking almost pleased, I fired off shot after shot, arms shaking from the weight.

Home,Chem break sunset,"I was supposed to be doing chemistry when the light in my room suddenly shifted. My notes went pale lavender, and I looked up to see the sky over Del Mar exploding—orange, magenta, that over-the-top post–daylight-savings kind of sunset. I pressed my forehead to the cool window, watching palm trees turn into sharp black cutouts. For a few minutes, electrons and reaction rates fell completely out of my head; it was just sky, ocean, and the reminder that the world didn’t care about my homework.",18:20,1/31/19,,sunset,"32.96° N, 117.27° W","	Eyes: homework break

Backyard,Hummingbird Nest,"I first spotted the nest in a front-yard bush—just a tiny cup with two perfect eggs. For days I’d crouch in the mulch, camera ready, until one afternoon the mother zipped in, hovered, and dropped straight into the nest. That’s when I knew it was a hummingbird. I kept visiting until the eggs became open beaks, and then found two more nests in the backyard like the neighborhood had quietly franchised them. Spring felt louder, greener, and oddly centered around these birds that didn’t know I existed.",16:29,3/29/19,,hummingbird,"32.96° N, 117.27° W","	•	Air: biting cold

Lam Watah Nature Trail,Hot reset hike,"That Tahoe trail felt like walking through someone else’s screensaver. The sun was strong, bouncing off dry dirt and tall grass, but the mountain air had a cool edge if I stopped long enough. I’d been sad for days, that heavy, cloud-in-chest kind of sad, but here the path wound between pines and wildflowers, opening up to views that looked vaguely European. By the time we looped back to the car, sweat drying on my back, my thoughts felt lighter, like they’d been shaken out along the way.",15:38,8/15/19,,tahoe,"39.1° N, 120.0° W","	•	Air: dry hillside heat

Kate Sessions Park,Birthday charcuterie,"For my friend’s 17th, we turned Kate Sessions Park into a picnic ad—salami roses, three too many cheeses, fruit spilling off a wooden board. Mission Bay and downtown glowed below us as the sun dropped. We talked about everything and nothing: crushes, colleges, the usual future panic. When the temperature finally crashed and everyone else cleared out, it was just the five of us in the dark, fingers numb from cold and brie, watching the city lights take over the show.",14:10,11/11/20,,charcuterie,"32.80° N, 117.24° W","	•	Air: bay chill

Del Mar train tracks,Acceptance-week exhale,"The week I got my college acceptances, I went to the Del Mar tracks for sunset. The air smelled like salt and creosote, that old-railroad scent. Waves rolled in on one side, and every so often a train roared past, dragging a wall of wind and noise that rattled my ribs. Between trains it was strangely quiet. I sat there feeling something I hadn’t felt in months—a sense that the future might actually be okay, like a pressure valve finally hissing open.",20:24,4/17/21,,traintrak,"32.96° N, 117.27° W","	•	Wind: train-rush

Torrey Highlands Park,Park Bench,"Torrey Highlands Park used to be chaos—kids, dogs, soccer games overlapping. After the first wave of COVID, it felt empty, like someone had turned the volume down. My friends and I claimed a bench as our headquarters, lugging sketchbooks and phones, taking turns drawing, venting, and doing half-serious TikTok dances in the grass. The sun was sharp, but the big trees cast generous shade. It felt like an in-between place: not quite the old world, not yet college, just this suspended summer where we kept showing up anyway.",15:44,4/22/21,,parkbench,"32.97° N, 117.14° W","	•	Air: post-covid quiet

Universal Studios Hollywood,Heatwave reride day,"That Universal Studios day felt like walking on a stovetop. The pavement shimmered, and even the shade felt sunburned. The only mercy came from the misting fans, which we treated like shrines—standing under them until our shirts were damp and our brains reset. Because the park was weirdly empty, we kept looping the same rides, counting how many times we could go without getting bored. By late afternoon I was sun-stunned and exhausted, but it lives in my head as one of the purest “we were so dumb and happy” days.",13:12,9/13/21,,universal,"34.14° N, 118.35° W","	•	Air: hot then mist

Oceanside,First train home,"On my first Amtrak ride home from college, everything outside the window looked strangely cinematic. The train hugged the coast, giving quick flashes of beach, surfers, and low gray water between telephone poles. Inside, the car smelled like coffee and plastic seats, the AC a little too cold. I pretended to do work but mostly watched the coastline and scrolled old photos. With every mile closer to Oceanside I felt both more grown-up and more homesick, like I was commuting between two versions of myself.",16:51,11/4/21,,amtrak,"33.20° N, 117.38° W","	•	Air: train air-conditioning

Getty Villa,Marble spring break,"During my first college spring break, we went to the Getty Villa instead of somewhere wild. The air was bright and almost warm, sunlight glancing off pale stone and columns. Fountains murmured in the courtyard, and the ocean flickered just beyond the walls.

Marina Bay,Purple-film skyline,"Singapore in summer felt like walking into a steamed bathroom that never cooled down. The moment I stepped outside the hotel, sweat bloomed along my hairline. I spent most of the trip darting between malls and air-conditioned tunnels, popping out just long enough to shoot Marina Bay Sands on my purple film—this surreal ship balanced on glass towers. Ten minutes outside was enough to make my clothes cling, but the skyline looked so unreal it felt worth melting for, at least in short bursts.",14:12,9/2/22,,mbs,"1.28° N, 103.86° E","	•	Air: dense humidity

Joshua Tree National Park,Desert dinner cocoon,"Our Joshua Tree Airbnb was surrounded by almost nothing—just desert, sky, and a road that disappeared into both. After dark the outside turned ink black and cold, but inside the kitchen glowed.

The venue was small and packed but not suffocating; my body felt warm from standing and singing, not from panic. Colored lights washed over us in slow waves while the room moved as one big organism.

Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes,Freezing sunrise climb,"We left in the dark to catch sunrise at Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes. The air was sharp and cold, the sky only a hint of blue. Walking uphill on sand felt like losing an argument with gravity—each step sliding back a little. Wind pushed against my jacket and needled my face.

The afternoon warmth sat heavily on my shoulders, but the second the sun dipped behind the mountains the temperature fell fast, as if someone opened a freezer door. The basin shifted from glowing white to eerie blue-gray. I remember standing still, listening to nothing—no wind, no bugs, just vast silence stretching out in every direction.

After that overly salty teriyaki chicken I felt the world tilt a little, and suddenly every sound was muffled, like hearing through cotton.

Within minutes my shirt clung to me, and the air tasted faintly metallic, like steam. I was halfway through the path when a chicken casually crossed in front of me, completely unbothered by my suffering. There were chickens everywhere—strutting, pecking, living their best lives. I slowed to a walk, drenched and wheezing, but laughing because now every time I think about running I’m reminded of that chicken and how effortlessly it moved through the heat that nearly defeated me.",14:23,7/6/23,,sgchicken,"1.29° N, 103.92° E","	•	Air: wet and heavy

I was there for a project, taking buses that felt like ovens between stops. Everything stuck to everything: my hair to my neck, my clothes to my back, my notebook pages to my palms.

My grandpa fished off the side of the boat with practiced calm while I failed to catch anything except sunburn. The water shimmered in a way that made everything feel slightly unreal.

Instead, the sky opened just enough to reveal Fuji—snowless in summer, its peak cutting sharply into the pastel sky. The air was chilly but gentle, the kind that settles quietly on your skin.

The window was cracked open and warm LA air drifted in, mixing with the faint scent of spilled drinks from the night before. It was a quiet, bittersweet moment, small but heavy with change.",01:50,5/10/25,,joc,"34.06° N, 118.45° W","	•	Air: warm apartment

UCLA Royce Hall,Fizzy graduation,"On the UCLA lawn, sunlight bounced off every champagne bottle in sight. When my friend popped ours, cold spray shot across my arms and face—shockingly chilly, sticky as it dried. People around us were shouting, laughing, tossing caps into the air. Royce Hall glowed in the background like a backdrop someone carefully chose for us. My shoes were wet, the grass was damp, and my voice was already hoarse from cheering. It felt like standing inside a bubble of celebration, brief and bright and fizzy in every sense.",14:12,6/5/25,,champagne,"34.07° N, 118.44° W","	•	Air: noon heat

Tillinghast Beach,Moonrise,"The first time I visited the “RISD beach,” the air surprised me—it was so much hotter than I expected for Rhode Island. The sand was coarse, almost pebbly, scratching lightly against my feet as I walked toward the shoreline. When the moon began to rise, the sky shifted into soft pastels, and the whole beach fell into this peaceful quiet. Waves lapped slowly, and the warm wind carried a faint salty heaviness. It felt like a different coast entirely, new but strangely comforting, like a small beginning.",19:44,8/7/25,,risdbeach,"41.74° N, 71.38° W","	•	Air: warm breeze

Roger Williams Zoo,Coldest Halloween,"At Roger Williams Park Zoo’s pumpkin walk, everything glowed—a tunnel of carved faces, lanterns, and lights flickering against the trees. But it was freezing. I’d stupidly worn a costume with shorts, and the cold gnawed straight through my legs. My breath puffed out in little clouds as crowds shuffled past, kids pointing at their favorite pumpkins. My fingers were numb, but the warm orange glow everywhere made the night feel magical. It was the kind of cold you complain about nonstop, but secretly love because the memory shines brighter because of it.",22:17,10/31/25,,pumpkin,"41.79° N, 71.41° W","	•	Air: biting cold
